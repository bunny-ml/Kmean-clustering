# üõçÔ∏è Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

This project applies **K-Means Clustering** on customer transaction data to segment users into actionable groups using **RFM analysis** (Recency, Frequency, Monetary). The primary goal is to understand and optimize marketing strategies for each customer group based on purchasing behavior.

## üìä Customer Segments

The following customer segments were identified using K-Means clustering based on RFM features:

| **Cluster** | **Segment Name** | **Description** |
| :---------- | :--------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0           | **RETAIN** | Customers who purchase regularly but spend a moderate amount. They're important to retain with consistent service. |
| 1           | **REWARD** | Loyal, high-frequency, and high-spending customers. They are the most valuable and should be rewarded with loyalty perks. |
