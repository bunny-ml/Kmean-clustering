## üìä Customer Segments
---
The following customer segments were identified using K-Means clustering based on RFM features:

| Cluster | Segment Name | Description |
|---------|--------------|-------------|
| 0       | **RETAIN**   | Customers who purchase regularly but spend a moderate amount. They're important to retain with consistent service. |
| 1       | **REWARD**   | Loyal, high-frequency and high-spending customers. They are the most valuable and should be rewarded with loyalty perks. |
| 2       | **RE-ENGAGE**| Previously active customers who haven't purchased in a while. Marketing campaigns should aim to re-engage them. |
| 3       | **NURTURE**  | New or low-frequency buyers. Potential to grow into loyal customers through nurturing and onboarding. |
| -1      | **PAMPER**   | Low-frequency customers who make high-value purchases. They respond well to personalized, high-touch offers. |
| -2      | **UPSELL**   | Customers who purchase frequently but spend less. Potential to introduce them to premium offerings. |
| -3      | **DELIGHT**  | Ideal customers with recent, frequent, and high-value purchases. Top tier ‚Äì delight them to ensure long-term loyalty. |
